   She had always been short and fat and slightly bent. Her face was a criss-cross of wrinkles running from everywhere to everywhere. No, we were certain she had always been as we had

known her. Old, so terribly old that she could not have grown older, and had stayed at the same age for twenty years. She could never have been pretty; but she was always beautiful. She hobbled about the house in spotless white with one hand resting on her waist to balance her stoop and the other telling the beads of her rosary. Her silver locks were scattered untidily over her pale, puckered face, and her lips constantly moved in inaudible prayer. Yes, she was beautiful. She was like the winter landscape in the mountains, an expanse of pure white serenity breathing peace and contentment.
   My grandmother and I were good friends. My parents left with her when they went to live in the city and we were constant
together. She used to wake me up in the morning and get,_.-._,.,. ready for school. She said her morning prayer in a monot i- ­ sing-song while she bathed and dressed me in the·...-.-.tPII_,,

   When  parents were comfortably settled in the city, they sent for	waasturning-point in our friendship. Although we d esame room, my grandmother no longer came to sc ol · me. I used to go to an English school in a motor bus.  ere were no dogs in the streets and she took to feeding sparrows in the courtyard of our city house.
   As the years rolled by we saw less of each other. For some time she continued to wake me up and get me ready for school. When I came back she would ask me what the teacher had





THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY	5

taught me. I would tell her English words and little things of western science and learning, the law of gravity, Archimedes' Principle, the world being round, etc. This made her unhappy. She could not help me with my lessons. She did not believe in the things they taught at the English school and was distressed that there was no teaching about God and the scriptures. One day I announced that we were being given music lessons. She was very disturbed. To her music had lewd associations. It was the monopoly of harlots and beggars and not meant for gentlefolk. She said nothing but her silence meant disapproval. She rarely talked to me after that.

She came to leave me at the railway station but			k or show any emotion. Her lips moved in prayer, her was lost in prayer. Her fingers were busy telling the		of her rosary.

   But t was nost oA. fter five years I came back home and was me  M at the station. She did not look a day older. She
sti l a	time for words, and while she clasped me in her ar  I  uld hear her reciting her prayers. Even on the first day of m  rival, her happiest moments were with her sparrows whom she fed longer and with frivolous rebukes.
   In the evening a change came over her. She did not pray. She collected the women of the neighbourhood, got an old drum and started to sing. For several hours she thumped the sagging

skins of the dilapidated drum and sang of the home-coming of warriors. We had to persuade her to stop to avoid overstraining. That was the first time since I had known her that she did not pray.
   The next morning she was taken ill. It was a mild fever and the doctor told us that it would go. But my grandmother thought differently. She told us that her end was near. She said that, since only a few hours before the close of the last chapter of her life she had omitted to pray, she was not going to waste any more time talking to us.
   We protested. But she ignored our protests. She laypeacefuh in bed  praying and telling her beads. Even before we cou suspect, her lips stopped moving and the rosary fell fro <\ lifeless fingers. A peaceful pallor spread on her face and we
