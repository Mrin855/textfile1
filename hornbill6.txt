"But no problem, sir", he assured us, "if there is no snow." What was the likelihood of that I asked. "Not knowing, sir, until we get there."
   From the gently rolling hills of Ravu, the short cut took us across vast open plains with nothing in them except a few gazelles

dogwould make chase for a hundred metres or so before easing off, having seen us off the property. It wasn't difficult to understand why ferocious Tibetan mastiffs became popular in China's imperial courts as hunting dogs, brought along the Silk Road in ancient times as tribute from Tibet.
   By now we could see snow-capped mountains gathering on the horizon. We entered a valley where the river was wide and mostly clogged with ice, brilliant white and glinting in the sunshine. Thetrail hugged its bank, twisting with the meanders as we gradually gained height and the valley sides closed in.
   The turns became sharper and the ride bumpier, Tseta now in third gear as we continued to climb. The track move away from the icy river, labouring through steeper slopes sported big rocks daubed with patches of bright orange li Beneath the rocks, hunks of snow clung on in				- permanent shade.

The snow	1 ok too deep to me, but the danger wasn't
its depth, Dan 1 , so much as its icy top layer. "If we slip off,
the	turn over," he suggested, as we saw Tsetan grab
handfu				· t and fling them across the frozen surface. We bot i			inand, when the snow was spread with soil, Daniel an	s		ed out of the vehicle to lighten Tsetan's load. He backed up a		drove towards the dirty snow, eased the car on to its icy surface and slowly drove its length without apparent difficulty. Ten minutes later, we stopped at another blockage. "Not good, sir," Tsetan announced as he jumped out again to survey the scene. This time he decided to try and drive round the snow.

The slope was steep and studded with major rocks, but somehow Tsetan negotiated them, his four-wheel drive vehicle lurching from one obstacle to the next. In so doing he cut off one of the hairpin bends, regaining the trail further up where the snow had not drifted.
   I checked my watch again as we continued to climb in the bright sunshine. We crept past 5,400 metres and my head began to throb horribly. I took gulps from my water bottle, which is supposed to help a rapid ascent.
   We finally reached the top of the pass at 5,515 metres. It was marked by a large cairn of rocks festooned with white silk
and	ragged prayer flags. We all took a turn round the cairn, in
clockwise direction as is the tradition, and Tsetan check d tyres on his vehicle. He stopped at the petrol tank and p	· unscrewed the top, which emitted a loud hiss.		r

Lhasa, found	m a truck so Tsetan and I bade him farewell

   Hor was a grim, miserable place. There was no vegetation whatsoever, just dust and rocks, liberally scattered with years of accumulated refuse, which was unfortunate given that the town sat on the shore of Lake Manasarovar, Tibet's most





SILK ROAD	63

venerated stretch of water. Ancient Hindu and Buddhist cosmology pinpoints Manasarovar as the source of four great Indian rivers: the Indus, the Ganges, the Sutlej and the Brahmaputra. Actually only the Sutlej flows from the lake, but the headwaters of the others all rise nearby on the flanks of Mount Kailash. We were within striking distance of the great mountain and I was eager to forge ahead.
   But I had to wait. Tsetan told me to go and drink some tea in Hor's only cafe which, like all the other buildings in town, was constructed from badly painted concrete and had three broken windows. The good view of the lake through one of them helpe to compensate for the draught.
   I was served by a Chinese youth in military uniforYe, spread the grease around on my table with a filthy rag bringing me a glass a:r}d a thermos of tea.
   Half an hour later, Tsetan re i	d me from y/olary confinement and we drove past a		ore roe ,-	bbish

   Tired and hungry, I started breathing through my mouth. After a while, I switched to single-nostril power which seemed to be admitting enough oxygen but, just as I was  drifting off, I woke up abruptly. Something was wrong. My chest felt

strangely heavy and I sat up, a movement that cleared my nasal passages almost instantly and relieved the feeling in my chest. Curious, I thought.
   I lay back down and tried again. Same result. I was on the point of disappearing into the land of nod when something told me not to. It must have been those emergency electrical impulses again, but this was not the same as on previous occasions. This time, I wasn't gasping for breath, I was simply not allowed to go to sleep.
   Sitting up once more immediately made me feel better. I could breathe freely and my chest felt fine. But as soon as I 1 down, my sinuses filled and my chest was odd. I tried proppi myself upright against the wall, but now I couldn't mana relax enough to drop off. I couldn't put my finger on the re

   "It's a cold," hes	·		through Tsetan. "A cold and the effects of altitude. I'll		ou something for it."
   I asked hi if		hought I'd recover enough to be able to do the kora. "Oh	"		said, "you'll be fine."
   I walked o	e medical college clutching a brown envelope stuffed wV fifteen screws of paper. I had  a five-day course of
Tibetan e which I started right away. I opened an after­ breakfa:  ckage and found it contained a brown powder that I h a ewith hot water. It tasted just like cinnamon. The con t; of the lunchtime and bedtime packages were less obviously identifiable. Both contained small, spherical brown pellets. They looked suspiciously like sheep dung, but of course I took them. That night, after my first full day's course, I slept very soundly. Like a log, not a dead man.

   Once he saw that I was going to live Tsetan left me, to return to Lhasa. As a Buddhist, he told me, he knew that it didn't really matter if I passed away, but he thought it would be bad for business.
   Darchen didn't look so horrible after a good night's sleep. It was still dusty, partially derelict and punctuated by heaps of rubble and refuse, but the sun shone brilliantly in a clear blue sky and the outlook across the plain to the south gave me a vision of the Himalayas, commanded by a huge, snow-capped mountain, Gurla Mandhata, with just a wisp of cloud suspended over its summit.
   The town had a couple of rudimentary general stores selli Chinese cigarettes, soap and other basic provisions, as well the usual strings of prayer flags. In front of one, men gath

I'd been told that at the ·	t	the i	e season, the
town was bustling wit	vis1	s. Ma	ught their own
accommodation, 		sett!			ound its edges as they set up their t s ill			otnothpleain. I'd timed my arrival for	ginni	eason, but it seemed
I was too ear lY.
   One after	on sat pon 1rin	y options over a glass of tea in Darchen's		afe. Af i little consideration, I concluded
they were severely li  rly I hadn't made much progress with my self-help pr?g e onpositive thinking.

The ko a  s seasonal because parts of the route were liable to blocka		ow. I had no idea whether or not the snow had cleared,   I wasn't encouraged by the chunks of dirty ice that stil	to the banks of Darchen's brook. Since Tsetan had
left,l\actn'tcome across anyone in Darchen with enough English
to answer even this most basic question.
   Until, that is, I met Norbu. The cafe was small, dark and cavernous, with a long metal stove that ran down the middle. The walls and ceiling were wreathed in sheets of multi-coloured

66	HORNBILL

plastic, of the striped variety- broad blue, red and white-that is made into stout, voluminous shopping bags sold all over China, and in many other countries of Asia as well as Europe. As such, plastic must rate as oneof China's most successful exports along the Silk Road today.
   The cafe had a single window beside which I'd taken up position so that I could see the pages of my notebook. I'd also brought a novel with me to help pass the time.
   Norbu saw my book when he came in and asked with a gesture if he could sit opposite me at my rickety table. "You English?" he enquired, after he'd ordered tea. I told him I was, and we struck up a conversation.
I didn't think he was from those parts because he was weari
a windcheater and metal-rimmed spectacles of a Western tr!l>e,
He was Tibetan, he told me, but worked in Beijing at t . Academy of Social Sciences, in the I!ts·tute of Ethni   ra  re.
I assumed he was on some sort of    work.  ?
   "Yes and no," he said. "I have			do h ,, yheart jumped. Norbu had been wr· ·		em·c	s about the Kailash kora and its impo2	various  or s of Buddhist

Altho    I'd originally envisaged making the trek in the

we · e me yaks to carry our luggage, which I interpreted as a good ·gn, and he had no intention of prostrating himself all round the mountain. "Not possible," he cried, collapsing across the table in hysterical laughter. It wasn't his style, and anyway his tummy was too big.

Given below is an extract from an account of the Tethys Ocean downloaded from the Internet. Go online, key in Tethys Ocean in Google search and you will find exhaustive information on this geological event. You can also consult an encyclopedia.
Today, India, Indonesia and the Indian Ocean cover the area once occupied by the Tethys Ocean. Turkey, Iraq, and Tibet sit on the land once known as Cimmeria. Most of the floor of the Tethys Ocean disappeared under Cimmeria and Laurasia. We only know that Tethys existed because geologists like Suess have found fossils of ocean creatures in rocks in the Himalayas. So, we know those rocks were underwater, before the Indian continental shelf began pushing upward as it smashed into Cimmeria. We can see
similar geologic evidence in Europe, where the movement 'If'>
